Title: 'Negative biodiversity effects on broad but not on narrow functions in pitcher plant microbial communities ' 
Citation: To be updated upon acceptance 

Brief abstract: The relationship between Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function (BEF) addresses how communities transform their environment. BEF relationships can have positive, neutral, or negative slopes, yet it remains unclear what conditions result in a particular slope. A popular classification in microbial ecology distinguishes broad from narrow functions and we ask whether this distinction improves predictions of BEF relationships. Specifically, we evaluate whether the relationships between broad functions and diversity can be predicted based on (1) the combined slopes from underlying narrow functions, (2) the phylogenetic breadth of associated species and (3) their ecological dominance. We assembled bacterial communities from pitcher plant fluid, using a dilution-to-extinction approach to create a gradient in biodiversity. Darlingtonia californica are carnivorous plants that depend on their bacterial community to degrade insects that supplement their nitrogen requirements. We found a negative BEF relationship between bacterial richness and degradation, while narrow functions had positive and neutral BEF slopes. The narrow functions did not predict the BEF relationship for the broader function. We identified three species statistically associated with degradation: Clostridium sp. had a positive association, while Herbinix sp. and Dyadobacter sp. had negative associations.

# DATA & CODE FILE OVERVIEW
This data repository consist of data files, code scripts, and this README document, with the following data and code filenames and variables.  

## Contents and narrative
This manuscript shows broad functions can have negative BEF relationships while narrow functions can have a variety of slopes, with positive and neutral BEF slopes in our findings. 

A central figure in our manuscript shows the negative relationships between bacterial richness and degradation:
